<h1> Bellabeat Case Study</h1>

<h2> Introduction</h2>
As the final challenge of the Google Data Analytics Certificate, I was asked to complete a case study. There was two datasets I could choose from to carry out my analysis. One of the datasets contained data from 30 FitBit users, which is the dataset which I chose. The dataset contained different types of data like sleep, heart rate, and different measures of activity. I had to put myself in the shoes of a data analyst that worked for Bellabeat. Bellabeat is company that offers devices that track actvitiy, sleep, stress, and even menstrual cycle. My task was to analyze the data to identify trends and behaviors. I then had to use these trends and behaviors to drive market strategies for one of the Bellabeat products.
